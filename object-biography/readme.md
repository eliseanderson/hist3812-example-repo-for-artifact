# Object Biography

Raggedy Ann:
The original Raggedy Ann was created by American cartoonist-illustrator-author Johnny Gruelle. Originally literary characters, he made them into real life dolls sometime in the early 20th century (Hall 1999). They are known for their trademark red hair, red dress, and geometric facial features. (Walkup 2006). 

This Doll: 
The original doll was purchased in Ottawa sometime in the late 1960s by the Kaser family. The favorite toy of Jenny, it soon became worn as they traveled across Canada and New York. Due to the lack of money, Jennyâ€™s mother Sandra hand repaired the doll every couple of years. Only the legs of the original doll remained, the rest being from repairs made throughout the 60s and 70s (Kaser 2018). This reflects the time period and socioeconimic status (particularly in the maritimes) of making repairs over throwing away old objects. It also reflects stories in forms of the repairs from all over Canada, beginning and currently in Ottawa.
