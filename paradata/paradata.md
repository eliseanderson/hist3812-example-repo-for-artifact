Raggedy Ann Paradata

Introduction:
This is my 3D scan and model of a Raggedy Ann doll. The original doll was created in the late 1960’s and purchased in Ottawa, however as it traveled around Canada it became worn. As it became worn, it became repaired, with each new piece holding a history of a new location. It became its own unique dolls which can only exist under these specific circumstances. By becoming a 3D artifact, it’s current state is not only preserved but it also extends its story into the 21st century digital age. 

Why has it been created and for what use? 
On first glance, it may appear as if the audience is the owners of the doll. However, while it represents one story of Canada, it can be related to many stories of Canada. It is far from the only toy to be passed on and repaired in this way. This reflects a time in which mass production existed but there was more value in repairing what you had rather than simply throwing away. This particular doll has also traveled extensively, and each part was made in different provinces of Canada at different times. Being from the capital of Ottawa, it nicely reflects the bringing together of Canada as a whole. The doll itself may have little meaning to most, but its story certainly can be. By 3d scanning it, we preserve its story and state, as well as add to its own history.  

Approach and methods/steps
First, I created a studio using two filtered lamps for light, a blank background, and stool to place the doll on. I used my phone camera to take pictures of the doll from every angle in a circular pattern. Next, I masked these images using gimp to cut away the background. This allowed the final result to be cleaner. Finally I used Regard3D to match the images, create a point cloud, and the final surfaces. The result can be viewed on sketchfab dot com. 

Uncertainty and Alternate Interpretations
The uncertainty in the object is mainly due to it being so unique. Unlike a preservation of the original doll in which it was based on, its history is more complex and also more open to interpretation. I see it as a reflection of the time period as well as each province (with its story beginning and currently in Ottawa). However, what it means to each individual is entirely subjective.
